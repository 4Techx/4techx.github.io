Hereâ€™s a collection of prompts for different tricep workout types, tailored to fit your dynamic warrior theme:

### Tricep Workout Prompts:

1. **Tricep Dips**  
   Generate image The warrior supports his weight with both hands on a sturdy surface behind him, like a rock or ledge, while lowering his body and bending his elbows. His triceps flex intensely under the strain. His tattoos shimmer with sweat, and the lighting accentuates the sharp definition of his arms and shoulders, creating a cinematic, strength-focused scene.

2. **Overhead Tricep Extensions**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior lifts a heavy object (such as a stone or weight) overhead with both hands and lowers it behind his head. His arms extend fully as he engages his triceps. Tattoos ripple across his forearms, and the dramatic lighting highlights the tension in his muscles while keeping the background minimal.

3. **Close-Grip Pushups**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior performs a pushup with his hands placed close together beneath his chest, engaging his triceps and core. His body forms a straight line, and his focused expression conveys determination. Shadows emphasize the strain on his muscles, while tattoos decorate his flexed arms.

4. **Bench Press with Narrow Grip**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior lies on his back on a sturdy surface, pressing a heavy object (like a barbell or stone) upward with a narrow grip. His arms tremble with effort as his triceps take center stage. His tattoos swirl with motion as the scene captures his sheer power.

5. **Kickback Extensions**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior bends forward slightly, holding a weight in one hand while extending his arm straight back. His tricep is flexed, and the tattoos on his arm shimmer under the focused lighting. The minimal background keeps all attention on his deliberate and controlled movement.

6. **Skull Crushers**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior lies flat on his back, holding a heavy object in both hands, and lowers it toward his forehead, flexing his triceps as he controls the motion. His tattoos are visible as his arms strain, and the lighting highlights the tension in his muscles.

7. **Tricep Pull-Downs**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior stands tall, gripping a resistance rope or chain with both hands, pulling it downward using controlled force. His triceps engage fully, and the lighting accentuates the intricate tattoos on his arms and the raw strength in his movements.

8. **Isometric Tricep Hold**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior locks his arms straight behind him, holding tension in his triceps while standing tall. Tattoos curve around his flexed muscles, and dramatic lighting accentuates his sharp physique, keeping the focus on his powerful stance.

9. **Triangle Pushup**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior positions his hands in a triangle shape beneath his chest, performing a pushup that engages his triceps intensely. His arms tremble slightly under the effort, and shadows highlight every defined line of his muscular frame.

10. **Weighted Dips**  
   *Prompt:* The warrior performs dips while holding a heavy object (e.g., a large stone) tied to his waist. His triceps engage fully as he lowers himself on sturdy bars or rocks. Sweat glistens on his tattoos, and dramatic lighting brings out the tension in his arms.
