### **Core Concepts (Closures, Hoisting, Scope)**  
❓ **What is a closure, and why is it useful?**  
🔑 **Answer**: A closure is a function that "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished execution. Closures are often used for data privacy and creating function factories.  
```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // Lexical scope variable
  return function inner() {
    count++; 
    return count; 
  };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

### **ES6+ Features**  
❓ **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?** 🧠  
🔑 **Answer**:  
- `var`: Function-scoped and hoisted. Can be re-declared. 😵  
- `let`: Block-scoped. Can be re-assigned but not re-declared within the same scope. 🚀  
- `const`: Block-scoped. Cannot be re-assigned or re-declared. Great for constants! 🚫  

```javascript
const name = "Copilot"; 
name = "AI"; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

### **Promises and Async/Await**  
❓ **What is the difference between promises and async/await?** ✨  
🔑 **Answer**: Promises are objects representing eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Async/Await makes it easier to handle promises by writing cleaner, synchronous-like code.  
```javascript
// Promise Example
fetch("https://api.example.com")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Async/Await Example
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

### **Event Handling**  
❓ **How can you attach an event handler to an element?** 🖱️  
🔑 **Answer**: You can use `addEventListener` to attach event handlers dynamically. Example:  
```javascript
document.querySelector("#btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked! 🚀");
});
```

---

### **DOM Manipulation**  
❓ **How do you dynamically create and append a new DOM element?** 🏗️  
🔑 **Answer**: Use `createElement` and `appendChild` or modern `append`. Example:  
```javascript
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
newDiv.textContent = "Hello, DOM!";
document.body.appendChild(newDiv); // Appends to the body
```

### **Memory Management**  
❓ **How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?** 🗑️  
🔑 **Answer**: The garbage collector automatically removes unused objects from memory. Objects are eligible for collection if they are no longer reachable or referenced.  
Example:  
```javascript
let obj = { data: "Copilot" }; 
obj = null; // Unreachable and eligible for garbage collection
```

---

### **Error Handling**  
❓ **How do you handle errors in JavaScript?** ⚠️  
🔑 **Answer**: Use `try...catch` blocks for handling synchronous errors and `.catch()` or `async/await` with `try...catch` for asynchronous errors.  
```javascript
try {
  throw new Error("Oops! Something went wrong.");
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.message); // "Oops! Something went wrong."
}
```

---

### **Array Methods**  
❓ **What does the `map` method do?** 🗺️  
🔑 **Answer**: The `map` method creates a new array by transforming each element in the original array. Example:  
```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const squares = nums.map(num => num * num); // [1, 4, 9]
```

### **Object-Oriented Programming**  
❓ **What is the difference between a class and a constructor function?** 🏛️  
🔑 **Answer**:  
- A constructor function is the traditional way of creating objects.  
- Classes, introduced in ES6, are syntactic sugar over constructor functions. They use `class` keyword and make OOP more readable.  
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`;
  }
}
const copilot = new Person("Copilot");
console.log(copilot.greet()); // Hello, my name is Copilot!
```
