Your website has great potential, and I love how it focuses on workout plans with and without equipment. To make it more user-friendly and engaging, here are some suggestions tailored to what I saw:

1. **Streamline Navigation**:
   - Group similar categories in your navigation bar (e.g., learning and certifications can be combined into an "Education" section).
   - Consider using dropdown menus or collapsible categories for ease.

2. **Engage with Visuals**:
   - Replace static images with high-quality videos showing workouts. Movement grabs attention.
   - Use a consistent and vibrant color scheme that resonates with fitness (e.g., energetic colors like green or orange).

3. **Improve Call-to-Actions**:
   - Redesign the "View Upper Body Workout Plan" buttons to make them bigger and more eye-catching, maybe with hover animations.

4. **Focus on User Interaction**:
   - Add workout progress trackers or calendars so users can log their activities.
   - Include quizzes or surveys to recommend personalized workout plans.

5. **Testimonials and Success Stories**:
   - Share user stories or reviews alongside your workout plans to build trust.

6. **SEO Optimization**:
   - Make sure your text contains keywords people would search for, like "quick home workouts" or "equipment-free fitness."

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Test your website on various devices to ensure users can easily navigate it on phones and tablets.

8. **Accessibility**:
   - Add alt text to images and ensure the text contrasts well with the background for readability.

9. **Create Community**:
   - Start a blog or forum where users can share their experiences and interact with others.

10. **Gamify Workouts**:
   - Introduce challenges or leaderboards to make workouts more fun and competitive.
